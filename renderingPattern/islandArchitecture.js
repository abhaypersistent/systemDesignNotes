// The islands architecture encourages small, focused chunks of interactivity within server-rendered web pages. The output of islands is progressively enhanced HTML, with more specificity around how the enhancement occurs. Rather than a single application being in control of full-page rendering, there are multiple entry points. The script for these “islands” of interactivity can be delivered and hydrated independently, allowing the rest of the page to be just static HTML.
